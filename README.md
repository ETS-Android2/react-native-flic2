# react-native-flic2
This plugin enables you to connect to a Flic2 button made by Shortcut Labs.

This plugin is supported by the Flic2 SDKs
- Android: https://github.com/50ButtonsEach/flic2lib-android
- iOS: https://github.com/50ButtonsEach/flic2lib-ios

## Current implementation
Currently we have added unstable support for using Flic2 on Android. We are currently working hard on the initial version of iOS support.

## Unstable development
Until we reach version 1.0.0 stable, the API of this plugin might change every release. We will try our best to keep it consistent but can't promise anything at this point!

## API docs
The documentation is pending. Sorry!

## Getting started

`$ npm install react-native-flic2 --save`

### Mostly automatic installation

`$ react-native link react-native-flic2`

## Usage
```javascript
import Flic2 from 'react-native-flic2';
Flic2;
```

## Collaborating
We are happy to receive PRs! We have not published an NPM package before and are eager to learn!
