# react-native-flic2
This plugin enables you to connect to a Flic2 button made by Shortcut Labs. This plugin uses the https://github.com/50ButtonsEach/flic2lib-android SDK for Android integration. The iOS SDK has not been released yet and will be added later.

## Unstable development
Until we reach version 1.0.0 stable, the API of this plugin might change every release. We will try our best to keep it consistent but can't promise anything at this point!

## Getting started

`$ npm install react-native-flic2 --save`

### Mostly automatic installation

`$ react-native link react-native-flic2`

## Usage
```javascript
import Flic2 from 'react-native-flic2';

// TODO: What to do with the module?
Flic2;
```

## Collaborating
We are happy to receive PRs! We have not published an NPM package before and are eager to learn!
